    <p>
        iApply is a job application management and preparation tool. It is different than other apps because we not only
        help you manage your applications, but also provide insights to help you put your best resume forward. Much of
        initial resume parsing today is being done via computers rather than human recruiters, so tailoring your resume
        to the job requirements is increasingly important. Our mission is to ease the burden of tracking your
        applications so time can be better spent preparing for the opportunity itself.
