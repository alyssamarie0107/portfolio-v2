    <h1>Card Bank</h1>

    <p>
        Built for my ECS 189E course in Winter 2021. The app is a wallet, which can be broken down into three parts:
        login, wallet, and transaction.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        For the login part, Card Bank uses phone number authentication. It takes in a phone number from the user and
        sends a verification code to the phone number by text message. Card Bank then prompts the user to enter the code
        and verify user's identity (it is assumed that the user will use a US phone number only).
    </p>

    <p>
        For the wallet part, Card Bank displays the user's wallet, which has a table of accounts and the information of
        each account.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the transaction part, Card Bank allows the user to make transactions between the accounts in the wallet.
