    <h1>Postcard Generator</h1>
    <img alt="postcard" src="../../../../images/projects/web/postcard.png">

    <p>Keeping in touch with family and friends is important, espeically when we are busy and
        stressed. In this assignment for ECS 162: Web Programming, a postcard generator app was made that lets a
        user select a background color, upload a photo, and choose a font style to create a unique postcard that
        they can send to their loved ones.</p>
