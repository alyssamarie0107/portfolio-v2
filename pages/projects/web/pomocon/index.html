    <p>Pomocon is a website that acts as a Pomodoro timer. It allows users to select between a 25 minute work interval or 5/10/15 minute breaks. Pomocon displays the time interval the user selects and shows the exact time the interval will be done. The time interval is displayed in a aesthetically pleasing circle, which depletes with time accordingly. When the timer is up, an audio notification plays to let the user know that they completed a Pomodoro or that their break is over. Pomocon also keeps track of the user's total time for their session on Pomocon. The user will be able to see their work time, break time, total time, completed Pomodoros, and efficiency.</p>
